Drug discovery
1.	METHOD
Preparation of ligands
A ligand library comprising approximately 1,000 low molecular weight compounds was obtained from the PubChem database in SDF format. The ligands were imported into the Maestro 12.5 workspace (Schrödinger, LLC) and prepared using the LigPrep module. Preparation involved applying the OPLS3e force field, generating possible ionization and tautomeric states at pH 7.0 ± 2.0 using Epik, and desalting to remove counterions. Stereoisomer enumeration was enabled, allowing up to 32 stereoisomers per ligand. The output was saved in Maestro native (.mae) format for compatibility with downstream docking procedures.

Protein preparation
The crystal structures of blaOXA-181 and blaNDM-1 (PDB IDs: 5OE0 and 6LIP, respectively) were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank and imported into Maestro 12.5. Protein preparation involved 3 phases (preprocessing, optimizing and minimizing) and was carried out using the Protein Preparation Wizard. Bond orders were assigned, and all water molecules beyond 0 Å from hetero groups were removed. The protonation states of ionizable residues and hetero groups were predicted at pH 7.0 ± 2.0 using Epik and optimized via PROPKA. Hydrogen bonds were assigned, and the hydrogen-bonding network was refined to ensure correct protonation and tautomeric states. The proteins were subjected to restrained energy minimization using the OPLS3e force field with a heavy atom RMSD cutoff of 0.30 Å to relieve steric clashes while preserving the experimental crystal conformation.
Site mapping and receptor grid generation
Due to the presence of chloride (Cl⁻) and sulfate (SO₄²⁻) ions as natural ligands in the blaOXA-181 structure, which are not representative of typical binding interactions, SiteMap analysis was conducted to identify potential binding pockets. The top two highest-scoring sites predicted by SiteMap were selected as the target regions for docking studies. For blaNDM-1, receptor grids were generated by centering on the co-crystallized ligand (D-captopril) to define the binding site. Grid generation was performed using the Receptor Grid Generation panel in Maestro, with default van der Waals scaling of 1.0 for receptor atoms and a partial charge cutoff of 0.25. The grid box dimensions were adjusted to fully encompass the binding pockets.
Molecular docking
An initial molecular docking was conducted using the Glide module in Standard Precision (SP) mode to efficiently screen the entire ligand library against the prepared receptor grids of blaOXA-181 and blaNDM-1. All LigPrep-prepared ligands were flexibly docked, allowing for conformational flexibility during the docking process to better approximate realistic binding modes. Following this preliminary screening, the top 50 highest-scoring ligands based on  docking Score were selected for further refinement via Extra Precision (XP) docking. The XP docking protocol applies more rigorous scoring functions and enhanced sampling techniques to better discriminate true binders from false positives. Both SP and XP docking procedures incorporated post-docking minimization to optimize ligand poses within the active site, as well as penalties for ligand conformations that deviate significantly from physically plausible geometries. 
Binding free energy calculation
The binding affinities of the top-ranked ligand-protein complexes were further evaluated using the Prime MM-GBSA module. This approach estimates the binding free energy (ΔG_bind) by calculating the difference between the minimized energies of the complex, the isolated protein, and the ligand. Calculations were performed using the OPLS3e force field and the VSGB solvation model with default settings.
ADMET prediction
Selected high-affinity ligands were assessed for their pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles using the QikProp module. Key properties including predicted aqueous solubility, logP, permeability, human oral absorption, and Lipinski’s Rule of Five compliance were evaluated. Ligands that met acceptable thresholds for drug-likeness and exhibited no major ADMET liabilities were prioritized as potential candidates.
